Deepkit Framework the new high-performance and real-time Typescript framework for sophisticated isomorphic Typescript
projects like complex admin interfaces, games, desktop and mobile apps.

Deepkit Framework consists of many high-performance Typescript components aka packages,
that can be used alone or in combination with the framework.

Deepkit Framework is all about high-performance:

 - High-performance in terms of execution speed.
 - High-performance in terms of development speed.
 - Low development costs by using a single tech-stack (Typescript) only for both, frontend and backend.
 
The economic advantage of isomorphic Typescript projects (frontend and backend written with Typescript) is enormous
and Deepkit Framework wants to utilize this advantage to its fullest.

**NOTE**: We have only recently started refactoring a huge portion of this project and work hard on the first release. 
**Website and docs will follow soon.**
